                        <h2>MoMA Mission statement</h2>
                        <p>Founded in 1929 as an educational institution, The Museum of Modern Art is dedicated to
                            being the foremost museum of modern art in the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>Through the leadership of its Trustees and staff, The Museum of Modern Art manifests this
                            commitment by establishing, preserving, and documenting a permanent collection of the
                            highest order that reflects the vitality, complexity and unfolding patterns of modern
                            and contemporary art; by presenting exhibitions and educational programs of unparalleled
                            significance; by sustaining a library, archives, and conservation laboratory that are
                            recognized as international centers of research; and by supporting scholarship and
                            publications of preeminent intellectual merit.
                        </p>
                        <p>Central to The Museum of Modern Art’s mission is the encouragement of an ever-deeper
                            understanding and enjoyment of modern and contemporary art by the diverse local,
                            national, and international audiences that it serves.
                        </p>
                        <p>To achieve its goals The Museum of Modern Art recognizes:

                        <ul>
                            <li> That modern and contemporary art originated in the exploration of the ideals and
                                interests generated in the new artistic traditions that began in the late nineteenth
                                century and continue today.</li>
                            <li>That modern and contemporary art transcend national boundaries and involve all forms
                                of
                                visual expression, including painting and sculpture, drawings, prints and
                                illustrated
                                books, photography, architecture and design, and film and video, as well as new
                                forms
                                yet to be developed or understood, that reflect and explore the artistic issues of
                                the
                                era.</li>
                            <li>That these forms of visual expression are an open-ended series of arguments and
                                counter
                                arguments that can be explored through exhibitions and installations and are
                                reflected
                                in the Museum’s varied collection.</li>
                            <li>That it is essential to affirm the importance of contemporary art and artists if the
                            <li>Museum is to honor the ideals with which it was founded and to remain vital and
                                engaged
                                with the present.</li>
                            <li>That this commitment to contemporary art enlivens and informs our evolving
                                understanding
                                of the traditions of modern art.</li>
                            <li>That to remain at the forefront of its field, the Museum must have an outstanding
                                professional staff and must periodically reevaluate itself, responding to new ideas
                                and
                                initiatives with insight, imagination, and intelligence. The process of reevaluation
                                is
                                mandated by the Museum’s tradition, which encourages openness and a willingness to
                                evolve and change.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>In sum, The Museum of Modern Art seeks to create a dialogue between the established and
                            the experimental, the past and the present, in an environment that is responsive to the
                            issues of modern and contemporary art, while being accessible to a public that ranges
                            from scholars to young children.</p>

                        <h2>MoMA history</h2>
                        <p>
                            MoMA PS1, one of the oldest and largest nonprofit contemporary art institutions in the
                            United States, was founded in 1971 by Alanna Heiss as the Institute for Art and Urban
                            Resources Inc., an organization devoted to organizing exhibitions in underutilized and
                            abandoned spaces across New York City. In 1976, it opened the first major exhibition in its
                            permanent location in Long Island City, Queens, with the seminal Rooms exhibition. An
                            invitation for artists to transform the building’s unique spaces, Rooms established the MoMA
                            PS1 tradition of transforming the building’s spaces into site-specific art that continues
                            today with long-term installations by James Turrell, William Kentridge, Pipilotti Rist,
                            Lawrence Weiner, and others.
                        </p>
                        <p>For the next 20 years, the building was used as studio, performance, and exhibition space, in
                            support of artists from around the world. After a building-wide renovation, P.S.1
                            Contemporary Art Center (now MoMA PS1) reopened in 1997, confirming its position as the
                            leading contemporary art center in New York. True to the building’s history and form, the
                            renovation preserved much of the original architecture, as well as most of its unique
                            classroom-sized galleries.
                        </p>
                        <p>In 2000, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center became an affiliate of The Museum of Modern Art to
                            extend the reach of both institutions, and combine MoMA PS1’s contemporary mission with
                            MoMA’s strength as one of the greatest collecting museums of modern art.
                        </p>
                        <p>A true artistic laboratory, MoMA PS1 aspires to maintain its diverse and innovative
                            activities to continue to bring contemporary art to international audiences.
